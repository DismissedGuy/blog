Hey there, thanks for dropping by! What you're seeing right now is my first blog article, hopefully with many more to come. For a while now I've been wanting to document my technical adventures and share them with other people. However, I'd been putting this off for way too long until I came across Hashnode.

I am aiming for this place to mostly be about things I find interesting, projects I have been working on or other share-worthy material. If you want to see a post or series about a certain topic, feel free to let me know. I've already got some interesting topics lined up which I am planning to write about.

See you in my second post!

Test edit haha
